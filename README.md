# memory_sorter2
memory_sorter2 allows staging and checking against a current photo/video repository to flag duplicate and allowed non-duplicates into the library.
## Motivation
Being the family's tech. person, I took it upon myself became the family's photo and video repository manager.
 I soon found there were many duplicates in our current repo. Using memory_sorter1, I was able to
start with a clean baseline, and then using memory_sorter2, I am able to keep most duplicate photos and 
videos from finding their way into our library. The name came after a family member saying, "so it finds duplicate
 family memories", to which I had to agree! Which I did see other free and paid software's that do things similar, most seemed to look
 only at a date and size, but I was looking for actual image comparisons, which some file types will be checked by. I also did not fully trust an outside
 software looking over all these files in detail, so I opted to test my coding skill out to make these two apps.
